Built a machine learning model to predict house prices using property features such as zoning, lot area, building type, and construction year.
Performed data preprocessing, categorical encoding, feature scaling, and trained a Random Forest Regressor. Evaluated model performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score (R² ≈ 0.81)
The workflow demonstrates a complete regression pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation and prediction.

Features:
Data cleaning and missing value handling
Categorical feature encoding (Label Encoding)
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Train-test split for model validation
Random Forest Regressor for price prediction
Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score
Prediction for new input data.

Tech Stack:
Python, ML, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.
